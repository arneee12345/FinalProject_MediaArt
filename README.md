# FinalProject_MediaArt# 💡 Wimpossible

**A satirical web game about attention, distraction, and the absurdity of the modern interface.**

## 🎮 Description

_Wimpossible_ is a chaotic, visually overloaded clicking game that challenges the player's ability to stay focused amidst a flood of fun colorful distractions. Your only real goal? Keep clicking the 💡 lightbulb to earn points.

This project was developed as part of a media art and technology university seminar. It is my reflection on persuasive design, attention economy, and overstimulation in digital spaces.

## 🧠 Core Idea

The idea was to simulate a typical “attention war” environment using:
- 🔔 Interruptive popups that dodge your cursor
- ✨ Reward-like distractions with no value
- 📊 A fake leaderboard that manipulates you (you will always be 2nd place)
- 🤖 Final behavior-based commentary on your performance (to make you want to play again and try better/differently)

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (or use a local server for audio support).
3. Click “💡” to gain points.
4. Avoid all distractions — or don’t. The game will judge you either way.

## 📁 Files Overview

- `index.html` – Game UI and script includes
- `script.js` – Game logic and popup mechanics
- `style.css` – Meme-inspired maximalist UI
- `sfx/` – Sound effects (click, sparkle, wow, etc.)
- `README.md` – This file to give an overview over this project

## 🔊 Sound Effects

The game includes a variety of sounds to create dopamine overload. Users get different sounds for clicking real vs. fake popups:
- `click.mp3` – boring numb goal click
- `sparkle.mp3`, `coin.mp3`, `fireworks.mp3`, `confetti.mp3`, `wow.mp3` – fun meme sounds used randomly for distractions

## 🏁 Ending Logic

Based on your clicking behavior, you’ll receive an ironic final message.
